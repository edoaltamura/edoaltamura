# Hi there! 👋

I work as a "quantum" software engineer at the [Hartree Centre (STFC)](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/) in the UK. I am also a visiting research fellow affiliated with the University of Cambridge - [Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/) - fostering theoretical and computational chemistry research in partnership with STFC. Currently, I collaborate with [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum) (Switzerland, UK and Ireland), [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/), and [Algorithmiq](https://algorithmiq.fi/). I serve as an Advisory Board Member at the [Unitary Foundation](https://unitary.foundation/), a non-profit organisation dedicated to building a global quantum technology ecosystem that benefits all.

I am a lead developer of **[Qiskit Machine Learning](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning)**, a community product that can help you build and run machine learning workloads on quantum computers seamlessly using Qiskit.

### 💼 Professional track
Previously, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Manchester - [Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/) - doing research in galaxy cluster astrophysics using numerical multi-physics simulations ([SWIFT](https://github.com/SWIFTSIM)) and high-performance computers. I participate in the following collaborations and consortia:
- High-Energy Physics working group ([QC4HEP](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1484549/)) with IBM Quantum and CERN
- [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) space mission Consortium (Theory Science Working Group)
- [CMB Stage-4](https://cmb-s4.org/) experiments Collaboration
- [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users/science-working-groups) science working groups (cosmology, extragalactic continuum and gravitational waves)
- [Virgo Consortium](https://virgo.dur.ac.uk/) for Computational Cosmology Research 
- Particles At heXascale (PAX) program within [ExCALIBUR](https://excalibur.ac.uk/) 


### 🌍 Open-source
I am passionately committed to the principles of _open science_ and _open data_, viewing them as drivers of impactful innovation and discovery. Are you interested in finding out more? Read the [European Commission open science principles](https://rea.ec.europa.eu/open-science_en). If you are specifically interested in how the EU shares open data, visit the Open Data Maturity reports and the Data Stories at [data.europa.eu - Publications Office of the EU](https://data.europa.eu/en/publications/overview), which I contributed to.

If you use software or data from my repositories, please include a citation following the guidelines in `README.*`, `CITATION.bib` or `__cite__.py`. Get in touch for details or enquiries!

### 🤝 Team-up 
Whether you're a seasoned coder or a curious beginner, your ideas and input could be the key to unlocking the next level of development. So please, delve into the code ☕, experiment and share your thoughts by ✨*getting in touch!* ✨
