# Hi there! üëã

I work as a "quantum" software engineer at the [Hartree Centre (STFC)](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/) in the UK. I am also a visiting research fellow affiliated with the University of Cambridge - [Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/) - fostering theoretical and computational chemistry research in partnership with STFC. Currently, I collaborate with [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum) (Switzerland, UK and Ireland), [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/), and [Algorithmiq](https://algorithmiq.fi/).

I am a core developer of **[Qiskit Machine Learning](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning)**, a community product that can help you build and run machine learning workloads on quantum computers seamlessly using Qiskit.

### üíº Professional track
Previously, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Manchester - [Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/) - doing research in galaxy cluster astrophysics using numerical multi-physics simulations ([SWIFT](https://github.com/SWIFTSIM)) and high-performance computers. I participate in the following collaborations and consortia:
- High-Energy Physics working group ([QC4HEP](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1484549/)) with IBM Quantum and CERN
- [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) space mission Consortium (Theory Science Working Group)
- [CMB Stage-4](https://cmb-s4.org/) experiments Collaboration
- [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users/science-working-groups) science working groups (cosmology, extragalactic continuum and gravitational waves)
- [Virgo Consortium](https://virgo.dur.ac.uk/) for Computational Cosmology Research 
- Particles At heXascale (PAX) program within [ExCALIBUR](https://excalibur.ac.uk/) 


### üåç Open-source
I am passionately committed to the principles of _open science_ and _open data_, viewing them as drivers of impactful innovation and discovery. Are you interested in finding out more? Read the [European Commission open science principles](https://rea.ec.europa.eu/open-science_en). If you are specifically interested in how the EU shares open data, visit the Open Data Maturity reports and the Data Stories at [data.europa.eu - Publications Office of the EU](https://data.europa.eu/en/publications/overview), which I contributed to.

If you use software or data from my repositories, please include a citation following the guidelines in `README.*`, `CITATION.bib` or `__cite__.py`. Get in touch for details or enquiries!

### ü§ù Team-up 
Whether you're a seasoned coder or a curious beginner, your ideas and input could be the key to unlocking the next level of development. So please, delve into the code ‚òï, experiment and share your thoughts by ‚ú®*getting in touch!* ‚ú®
