### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my GitHub. 

I am a computational astrophysicist Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics and the University of Manchester. I collaborate with the Virgo Consortium of Computational Cosmology Research and the ExCALIBUR program.

My research areas and interests include:
- Simulations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodinamics
- Sub-grid physics schemes
- AGN feedback and coupling between BHs and large-scale ISM
- Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and hot-IGM dynamics
- HPC infrastructures for massively parallel simulations (weak-scaling and profiling)
- Software development for heterogeneous HPC systems

# ðŸ’¡ Open source statement
I am a strong advocate of open-source software and I make my personal contributions publicly accessible wherever possible. If you plan on using pieces of software from my repositories, please acknowledge the source or include a citation as appropriate.

# ðŸŽ¯ Team-up 
If you think part or my work would benefit your studies or projects (perhaps after some further development), please do not hesitate in getting in touch and discuss a potential collaboration. Provided that studies are science-related and data-driven, I am happy to discuss contributions to fields beyond those in the list above.
