## Hi there! üëã Welcome to my Project Hub. 

I am a Quantum Software engineer and research fellow in numerical multi-physics simulations with high-performance computing (HPC). As a physicist by training, I work at the [Hartree Centre (STFC)](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/) in the UK and collaborate with **[IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum)** (Switzerland and the United Kingdom offices). I am also affiliated with the [Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/) at the University of Manchester and I participate in the following collaboration consortia:
- üåå [Virgo Consortium](https://virgo.dur.ac.uk/) for Computational Cosmology Research 
- üñß  Particles At heXascale (PAX) program in [ExCALIBUR](https://excalibur.ac.uk/)
- üõ∞Ô∏è [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) space mission Consortium
- üì° [CMB Stage-4](https://cmb-s4.org/) experiments Collaboration 

# üìê What I am designing
- **[Qiskit Machine Learning](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning)**: a community product that supercharges the Qiskit infrastructure to solve problems with machine learning techniques.
- **[SWIFTzoom](https://github.com/edoaltamura/swiftzoom/tree/main)** is an agile library to automate analyses of zoom-in numerical @SWIFTSIM simulations, so that you can invest more in and accelerate ‚ö° your science.
- **[SWprofile](https://github.com/edoaltamura/swprofile/tree/main)** (nearly ready for official release!) is a toolkit to produce radial profiles üìâ of one or more objects from cosmological simulations. The best part? For the first time, you will be presented with _interpretable_ and _reproducible_ results, topped up with guidelines to share your workflow in your publications. As a bonus, it comes with features to fit multi-dimensional analytic models.

My research spans two domains: quantum & high-performance computing algorithms, and computational cosmology for galaxy evolution.

# üåç Open-source
I am passionately committed to the principles of _open science_ and _open data_, viewing them as the drivers of impactful innovation and discovery. My mission is to foster a collaborative scientific community, where the boundaries of knowledge are continually expanded through the free exchange of ideas and acknowledgement of intellectual property.

If you use software or data from my repositories, please acknowledge the source or include a citation. I include citation guidelines in `README.*`, `CITATION.bib` and `__cite__.py`. Get in touch for details or enquiries!

# ü§ù Team-up 
Thanks for viewing my profile and exploring my work! These projects thrive on the diversity and dynamism of open-source collaboration. Whether you're a seasoned coder or a curious beginner, your ideas and input could be the key to unlocking the next level of development. So please, delve into the code ‚òï, experiment, share your thoughts, and most importantly, ‚ú®*get in touch!* ‚ú® I can't wait to see the unique perspective you'll bring to our collective journey through open science.
