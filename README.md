### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my GitHub space. 

## `$ whoami`
I am a computational astrophysicist Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics and the University of Manchester. I collaborate with the Virgo Consortium of Computational Cosmology Research and the ExCALIBUR program.

## `$ cat research_areas`
- Simulations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodinamics
- Sub-grid physics schemes
- AGN feedback and coupling between BHs and large-scale ISM
- Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and hot-IGM dynamics
- HPC infrastructures for massively parallel simulations (weak-scaling and profiling)
- Software development for heterogeneous HPC systems

## `$ git commit -m "Citing my software"`
I am a strong advocate of open-source software and I therefore make my personal contributions publicly accessible. If you plan on using pieces of software from these repositories, please acknowledge Edoardo Altamura, or include a citation as appropriate.

## `$ mpirun -np $(nproc) ./collaborate`
If you think part or my work would benefit your studies or projects (perhaps after some further development), please do not hesitate in getting in touch and discuss a potential collaboration. Provided that studies are science-related and data-driven, I am happy to discuss contributions to fields beyond those in the `research_areas` list.

## `$ ping edoaltamura`
