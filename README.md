## Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my Project Hub. 

I am a research fellow in high-performance computing (HPC) and numerical multi-physics simulations. I am a physicist by training and work at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (University of Manchester, UK) in collaboration with:
- 🌌 [Virgo Consortium](https://virgo.dur.ac.uk/) for Computational Cosmology Research 
- 🖧  Particles At heXascale (PAX) program in [ExCALIBUR](https://excalibur.ac.uk/)
- 🛰️ [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) space mission Consortium
- 📡 [CMB Stage-4](https://cmb-s4.org/) experiments Collaboration 

# 📐 What I am designing
- **[SWIFTzoom](https://github.com/edoaltamura/swiftzoom/tree/main)** is an agile library to automate analyses of zoom-in numerical @SWIFTSIM simulations, so that you can invest more in and accelerate ⚡ your science.
- **[SWprofile](https://github.com/edoaltamura/profile/tree/main)** (nearly ready for official release!) is a toolkit to produce radial profiles 📉 of one or more objects from cosmological simulations. The best part? For the first time, you will be presented with _interpretable_ and _reproducible_ results, topped up with guidelines to share your workflow in your publications. As a bonus, it comes with features to fit multi-dimensional analytic models.
- **Hourglass** (part of _SWprofile_) is coming soon! ⌛️ Look at the radial distribution of gas through a new lens. Build interpretable radial profiles and probe the baryonic physics shaping your galaxies.
- **SWconnect** is coming soon! Organise the metadata, I/O files and workflow intermediate files of your complex simulation project in a systematic, memorable way. No more need to treasure-hunt for your cooling tables or output list!  

My research focuses on galaxy evolution through cosmic time, and the thermodynamic environments of groups and massive clusters of galaxies.

# 🌍 Open-source
I am passionately committed to the principles of _open science_ and _open data_, viewing them as the drivers of impactful innovation and discovery. My mission is to foster a collaborative scientific community, where the boundaries of knowledge are continually expanded through the free exchange of ideas and acknowledgement of intellectual property.

If you use software or data from my repositories, please acknowledge the source or include a citation. I include citation guidelines in `README.*` and `__cite__.py`. Get in touch for details or enquiries!

# 🤝 Team-up 
Thanks for viewing my profile and exploring my work! These projects thrive on the diversity and dynamism of open-source collaboration. Whether you're a seasoned coder or a curious beginner, your ideas and input could be the key to unlocking the next level of development. So please, delve into the code ☕, experiment, share your thoughts, and most importantly, ✨*get in touch!* ✨ I can't wait to see the unique perspective you'll bring to our collective journey through open science.
