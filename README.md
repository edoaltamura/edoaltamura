### Hi there! 👋 welcome to my Project Hub. 

I am a researcher in numerical multi-physics simulations with high-performance computers (HPC). As an astrophysicist by training, I work at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (University of Manchester, UK), and collaborate with the:
- 🌌 Virgo Consortium of Computational Cosmology Research 
- 🖧 Particles At heXascale (PAX) program
- 🛰️ Euclid space mission Consortium

My research focuses on galaxy evolution through cosmic time, and the thermodynamic environments of groups and massive clusters of galaxies.

#### My interests:
- Data science pipelines at scale (100+TB)
- Software engineered for HPC infrastructures
- Optimization of HPC performance on parallel simulations
- Quantum computing, machine learning and sustainability
- Hydrodynamic simulations
- Sub-grid physics schemes
- Entropy distribution in clusters of galaxies
- AGN feedback coupling between black holes and their environments
- Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects

# 🌍 Open-source
I am passionately committed to the principles of _open science_ and _open data_, viewing them as the drivers of impactful innovation and discovery. My mission is to foster a collaborative scientific community, where the boundaries of knowledge are continually expanded through the free exchange of ideas and acknowledgemnt of intellectual property.

If you use software or data from my repositories, please acknowledge the source or include a citation as appropriate. I include citation guidelines in the `README` file - get in touch for further details or enquiries.

# 🤝 Team-up 
Thanks for viewing my profile and exploring my work! These projects thrive on the diversity and dynamism of open-source collaboration. Whether you're a seasoned coder or a curious beginner, your ideas and input could be the key to unlocking the next level of our development. So please, delve into the code ☕, experiment, share your thoughts, and most importantly, ✨*get in touch!* ✨ I can't wait to see the unique perspective you'll bring to our collective journey through open science.
